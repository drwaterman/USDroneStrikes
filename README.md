# USDroneStrikes
This is the final project for the Coursera course "Developing Data Products". It contains a Shiny webapp that displays US Drone Strike data from Google Sheets, provided by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The data is downloaded in real time and the plot includes options to choose what countries and what type of casualties to display.
